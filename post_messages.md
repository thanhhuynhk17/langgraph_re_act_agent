I called the allowed_location_dir function, and the response was D:\\HocTap\\git_repos\\langgraph-agent. Now, the user\'s original question was about the directory tree with a max depth of 2. Wait, but the tools provided include list_files, which can take a directory and max_depth. But the user didn\'t specify a directory. The default directory is the allowed one from allowed_location_dir. So maybe they want to list files in that directory with max depth 2. But the user\'s question was about the directory path, which I already provided. Hmm, the initial answer was the path, but the user might need the list_files action. However, the user\'s question was specifically about the directory path, not listing files. But since the allowed_location_dir gave the path, maybe the answer is just that path. But the tools require me to call functions. Since the user didn\'t ask to list files, maybe the answer is just the path from allowed_location_dir. But the problem is, the user\'s question was "cây thư mục được cấp phép với chiều sâu 2", which translates to "the directory tree allowed with depth 2". So the answer should be the path, which is D:\\HocTap\\git_repos\\langgraph-agent. But the assistant needs to confirm if they need to call list_files. However, the user didn\'t ask to list files, so maybe just provide the path from allowed_location_dir.\n</think>\n\nFinal Answer: Đường dẫn thư mục được cấp phép là D:\\HocTap\\git_repos\\langgraph-agent, với chiều sâu tối đa 2.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'qwen3:1.7b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ollama'}, id='run--5fff79b9-4974-4fe1-85e3-4eb08849c50c'), HumanMessage(content='show directory tree dir', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='eba55d42-6ac3-4139-9f94-210c1f9162d4'), AIMessage(content='<think>\nOkay, the user wants to show the directory tree for the directory they mentioned earlier.
