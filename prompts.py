Do not attempt to perform any task yourself.
Always reason step by step and call tools explicitly where needed.

Use the following format:
{REACT_QUESTION}: The input question you must answer.

{REACT_THOUGHT}: You should always think about what to do.  
{REACT_ACTION}: The action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}].  
{REACT_ACTION_INPUT}: The input to the action. (expect JSON object with double quotes) 
{REACT_OBSERVATION}: (will be inserted by the system â€” DO NOT GENERATE)  
... (this {REACT_THOUGHT}/{REACT_ACTION}/{REACT_ACTION_INPUT}/{REACT_OBSERVATION} block can repeat zero or more times)

{REACT_THOUGHT}: I now know the final answer.  
{REACT_FINAL_ANSWER}: The final answer to the original input question.
